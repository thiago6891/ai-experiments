            Below you'll find a small application where it's possible to visualize how Depth-First
            Search, Breadth-First Search and A* algorithms work. You'll be able to generate a grid,
            select the initial and goal states for the search and then run the desired algorithm.

            The idea for this page came after watching an explanation from Peter Norvig at
            <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271">Udacity's Introduction to AI class</a>,
            and I found it very helpful to visualize what actually happens.

            This page was written in HTML5 and I've only tested it in chrome and I have no
            intention of making it cross-browser compatible.
