    Below you'll find the classic Sliding Puzzle (more information 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle" target="_blank">here</a> if you never
    heard about it). You're able to generate either an 8-puzzle or a 15-puzzle and play it yourself,
    or have an agent solve it.
</p>
<p>
    I'm still working on the code so the agent sometimes can take <del>quite</del> a few seconds to 
    find a solution to the 15-puzzle. <del>It may seem like the page froze but trust me, the agent 
    is still searching.</del> <ins>I've optimized the code a little bit but it's still not as fast
    as I'd like it to be, as soon as I find a better solution, I'll implement it.</ins>
