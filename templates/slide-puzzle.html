    Below you'll find the classic Sliding Puzzle (more information 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle" target="_blank">here</a> if you never
    heard about it). You're able to generate either an 8-puzzle or a 15-puzzle and play it yourself,
    or have an agent solve it.
</p>
<p>
    I'm still working on the code so the agent sometimes can take quite a few seconds to find a 
    solution to the 15-puzzle. It may seem like the page froze but trust me, the agent is still 
    searching.
