<h1>
    Problem Searching
</h1>
<p>
    Below you'll find a small application where it's possible to visualize how Depth-First
    Search, Breadth-First Search and A* algorithms work. You'll be able to generate a grid,
    select the initial and goal states and then run the desired algorithm.<br />
    The grid's size should be a number between 2 and 500.
</p>
<h2>
    A word about heuristics
</h2>
<p>
    One interesting aspect to notice in the A* search algorithm is how the choice of a good
    heuristic can impact the search time.<br />
    In the grid below for instance, the estimated cost from a state to the goal is calculated by 
    flooring the length of a straight line from these two states, which is clearly a lower-bound on 
    the true cost, but we should notice that if the initial and goal states are located in the same 
    row or column, our heuristic function calculates the exact cost to reach the goal and, 
    therefore, the search time is faster than searching for a solution from any state to a goal 
    that's placed diagonally from it.<br />
    This can be easily verified by experimenting with the grid below.
