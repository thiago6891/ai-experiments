    In this site you'll find small experiments in AI. The idea for this page came after 
    watching an explanation from Peter Norvig at
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271">Udacity's Introduction to AI class</a>,
    and I found it very helpful to visualize what actually happens in Depth-First Search,
    Breadth-First Search and A* algorithms.

    The code for this web site can de found at 
    <a href="https://github.com/thiago6891/ai-experiments">github</a>. Feel free to give
    any feedback.
